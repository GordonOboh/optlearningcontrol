    "## Instructions\n",
    "Answer all the questions in the 4 parts below. You will need to submit:\n",
    "1. A report (pdf format only - every other format will be rejected) answering all the questions that do not request code. DO NOT include code in the report.\n",

Our task here will be to design a LQR controller that keeps the robot at a predefined position. Since the dynamics is not linear, we need to compute a linear approximation of it.\n",

    "3. Using the linearized dynamics, we can design an infinite horizon LQR controller of the form, $\\hat{u} = K \\bar{z}$ to stabilize the resting point. Write the equations of the controller in the original coordinates $u$ as a function of $z$.\n",
    "4. Design an infinite-horizon LQR controller that stabilizes the origin $z=0$ and test it using the simulator below.\n",
    "5. Explain your intended design in the report, including the cost function and found control law. In particular, verify that it can handle perturbations by calling the ```simulate``` function with ```disturbance = True``` (when setting disturbance to ``True``, the simulator will generate a random perturbation every 1 second). Simulate your controller for 10 seconds, plot the state evolution and show the animation (include the plots in your report)."

During the rest of the motion, the robot should try and stay close to the origin. It should also try to keep its control $u$ close to the control needed to keep the robot at rest. We want to make sure the robot reaches the origin $z=0$ at the end of the movement. \n",

    "6. Test the algorithm using as initial guess $u$ such that the robot is at rest (using the results of Part 1.2). Analyze your results (probably you will need to \"tune\" your cost function), plot the initial and final state and control trajectories, show the animation.

    "8. Use iLQR (and a new cost function) to get the quadrotor to perform the task. Analyze your results. \n",
