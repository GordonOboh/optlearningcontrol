    "1. A report (pdf format only - every other format will be rejected) answering all the questions that do not request code. DO NOT include code in the report.\n",

In particular, verify that it can handle perturbations by calling the ```simulate``` function with ```disturbance = True``` (when setting disturbance to ``True``, the simulator will generate a random perturbation every 1 second). Simulate your controller for 10 seconds, plot the state evolution and show the animation (include the plots in your report)."

    "6. Test the algorithm using as initial guess $u$ such that the robot is at rest (using the results of Part 1.2).
