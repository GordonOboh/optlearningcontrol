    "# Goal of the project\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to control a 2D quadrotor to perform acrobatic moves. There are 4 parts of the project, where you will build controllers of increasing complexity. The last part will lead to the implementation of the iterative LQR (iLQR) algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "Answer all the questions in the 4 parts below. You will need to submit:\n",
    "1. A report (pdf format only - every other format will be rejected) answering all the questions that do not request code. DO NOT include code in the report.\n",
    "2. One (or several) Jupyter notebook(s) containing all the code used to answer the questions. The notebook(s) should be runnable as is."

Our task here will be to design a LQR controller that keeps the robot at a predefined position. Since the dynamics is not linear, we need to compute a linear approximation of it.\n",

    "2. Write a function ```get_linearization(z, u)``` that returns the matrices A and B given a state $z$ and a control $u$ (use the constants defined in the ``quadrotor.py`` module).\n",
    "3. Using the linearized dynamics, we can design an infinite horizon LQR controller of the form, $\\hat{u} = K \\bar{z}$ to stabilize the resting point. Write the equations of the controller in the original coordinates $u$ as a function of $z$.\n",
    "4. Design an infinite-horizon LQR controller that stabilizes the origin $z=0$ and test it using the simulator below.\n",
    "5. Explain your intended design in the report, including the cost function and found control law. In particular, verify that it can handle perturbations by calling the ```simulate``` function with ```disturbance = True``` (when setting disturbance to ``True``, the simulator will generate a random perturbation every 1 second). Simulate your controller for 10 seconds, plot the state evolution and show the animation (include the plots in your report)."

    "Now we would like to do more complicated motions with the robot, like a flip. In this case, we do not have a prescribed trajectory but we would like to compute a locally optimal trajectory while we optimize the controller. We will use the *iterative LQR* algorithm to solve this problem.\n",
    "### Task 1 - reaching a vertical orientation\n",
    "In the first task, we want the robot to reach a vertical orientation $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ at the location $x=3$ and $y=3$ at time $t=5$ starting from $z_0=0$. During the rest of the motion, the robot should try and stay close to the origin. It should also try to keep its control $u$ close to the control needed to keep the robot at rest. We want to make sure the robot reaches the origin $z=0$ at the end of the movement. \n",
    "1. Find a time-varying cost function that promotes such a behavior (use only quadratic/linear terms for simplicity). Assume $T=10$ seconds.\n",
    "2. Write a function ```compute_cost(z,u, horizon_length)``` that returns the cost of a trajectory z with control trajectory u (using the cost function you wrote in question 1).\n",
    "3. Compute the quadratic approximation of your cost function along an arbitrary trajectory of states $z_n$ with control trajectory $u_n$ (this is not just your cost function!)\n",
    "4. Write a function ```get_quadratic_approximation_cost(z, u, horizon_length)``` that returns the quadratic approximation (Hessian matrices and Jacobians) of the cost function when approximated along the trajectory z with control trajectory u.\n",
    "5. Write the iLQR algorithm that solves the problem using the functions written above. DO NOT FORGET the line search step at each iteration. For the line search, start with $\\alpha = 1.$ and decrease it by half when the cost does not improve (you can stop when $\\alpha < 0.01$).\n",
    "6. Test the algorithm using as initial guess $u$ such that the robot is at rest (using the results of Part 1.2). Analyze your results (probably you will need to \"tune\" your cost function), plot the initial and final state and control trajectories, show the animation. Use the simulation without perturbations for simplicity. \n",

    "8. Use iLQR (and a new cost function) to get the quadrotor to perform the task. Analyze your results. \n",
